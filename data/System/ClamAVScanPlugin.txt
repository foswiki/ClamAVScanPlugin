---+!! <nop>ClamAV Scan Plugin

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin intercepts each attachment during upload and passes the content of
the attachment to the =clamd= daemon for virus scanning.  The attachment is
only saved if the virus scan does not detect any threats.  

From the description of !ClamAV at http://www.clamav.net

<noautolink>

<blockquote>
ClamAV is an open source (GPL) antivirus engine designed for detecting
Trojans, viruses, malware and other malicious threats. It is the de facto
standard for mail gateway scanning. It provides a high performance
mutli-threaded scanning daemon, command line utilities for on demand file
scanning, and an intelligent tool for automatic signature updates. The core
ClamAV library provides numerous file format detection mechanisms, file
unpacking support, archive support, and multiple signature languages for
detecting threats.

---++ Usage

No changes to existing topics are required by this plugin.  Once the plugin is enabled, attachments will be scanned during upload.  If a virus or other threat is detected, the upload will thow an exception, and the attachment will not be saved.  The scan is performed before the attachment is saved to disk.

This plugin is also able to scan the topic text prior to save.  This enables scanning for embedded MS Script encoded threats and for certain sensitive data formats such as credit card numbers and social security numbers. See the !ClamAV documentation on HTML scanning and the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) module for further information.

---+++ =%<nop>CLAMAVSTATUS%=

This macro returns status information from the =clamd= daemon.  Or reports any
failure messages if unable to connect to the clamd socket.  This information
is only displayed for administrators.

<dirtyarea>
%CLAMAVSTATUS{}%
</dirtyarea>

---+++ Scanning existing attachments.

The current attachments and attachment rcs =,v= files of an existing topic can be scanned using a rest handler.  Each attachment and corresponding rcs file if it exists is passed to clamd for scanning.  Results of the scan are reported back in the rest results.
There is no facility to request scan of an individual attachment.  The scan is done by reading the contents of the directory. The attachment API is not used. 

The rest handler takes two parameters: 
%TABLE{sort="off"}%
| *Parameter* | *Usage* | *Default* |
| =topic= | The =Web.Topic= used as the BASEWEB.BASETOPIC. | _System default topic_ |
| =scan= | The =Web.Topic= name that will be subject of the attachment scan. | =topic= |

<div class="foswikiHelp">Note that the extensions does not scan subdirectories of the attachment directory. If Foswiki is configured for the =PlainFileStore=, then attachment history will not be scanned.</div>

This operation is restricted to users in the Admin group.
---++++ Web interface:

<dirtyarea>
<form name="clamscan" action="%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/ClamAVScanPlugin/scan" method="post">
<input name="scan" class="foswikiInputField" type="text" value="%URLPARAM{"scan"}%" size="40" />
<input name="topic" type="hidden" value="%BASEWEB%.%BASETOPIC%" />
<input type="submit" class="foswikiSubmit" value="Scan attachments" />
</form>
</dirtyarea>

---++++ Shell interface

<verbatim>
   cd [Foswiki/bin] directory
   ./rest /ClamAVScanPlugin/scan -scan System.PatternSkin
</verbatim>

---+++ Reloading the Virus Signatures.

This plugin includes a rest handler to force reload of the virus signatures.  This operation is restricted to users in the Admin group.   The plugin sends a command to the clamd daemon to request the reload.

Note that reloading the signatures does not download newer signatures from !ClamAV.  It only reloads the existing signature files into the clamd daemon.

<dirtyarea>
<form name="clamreload" action="%SCRIPTURL{rest}%/ClamAVScanPlugin/reload" method="post">
<input name="topic" type="hidden" value="%BASEWEB%.%BASETOPIC%" />
<input type="submit" class="foswikiSubmit" value="ReloadSignatures" />

---++ Preferences

This plugin does not use any preferences.  All configuration is done using [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][%ICON{"wrench"}% configure]]

---++ Installation

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

%X% *Note:* This plugin depends upon a properly configured and operational version of the =clamd= daemon.  Actual scans are executed by the clamd daemon.  !ClamAV must be local to the Foswiki system.

---++ Configuration

This plugin uses the following settings:

<sticky>
<!--
   * #SMELL:   This is set to HTML entities to prevent recursive regex errors
   * in definition list processing.  Setting to :: causes recursion in the
   * render regex.

   * Set CC = &#58;&#58;
--></sticky>

   $ ==$Foswiki%CC%cfg{Plugins}{ClamAVScanPlugin}{clamdPort}==: The unix socket used to communicate with the =clamd= daemon. Defaults to =/tmp/clamd=

   $ ==$Foswiki%CC%cfg{Plugins}{ClamAVScanPlugin}{mandatoryScan}==: Should attach be blocked if clamd is unavailable to scan attachments. If this option is enabled, any attempt to attach a file will result in an error when clamd is not available. Default is disabled - Attachments will be added without scanning if =clamd= is unavailable.

   $ ==$Foswiki%CC%cfg{Plugins}{ClamAVScanPlugin}{scanTopics}==: !ClamAV can perform HTML scanning for certain embedded script threats. It can also perform "Data Loss Prevention". When =StructuredDataDetection= is enabled in clamd.conf, it will detect certain data such as social security numbers and credit card numbers in content. Default is disabled. Enable this option to perform scanning of topic data for structured data and embedded HTML threats. If a threat is detected, !ClamAV will block the topic save.

   $ ==$Foswiki%CC%cfg{Plugins}{ClamAVScanPlugin}{forceFilename}==: !Force scan by Filename instead of passing an open file handle to the backend.
<div class="foswikiAlert">
*Caution:* In addition to these settings, the =clamd.conf= setting =StreamMaxLength= needs to be large enough to accommodate the largest Foswiki setting for ATTACHFILESIZELIMIT.  Currently %ATTACHFILESIZELIMIT% in this web, this value can be set per web.
</div>

---+++ Dependencies

%$DEPENDENCIES%

*Note:* %X% =Socket::PassAccessRights= is "optional" however on most systems this module will be required for correct operation.   The =clamd= daemon must have full access to each scanned file.  This module allows a file descriptor to be passed to clamd ensuring full access.   If this module is not installed, the file _name_ will be passed to the clamd daemon.  If insufficient rights are available, the scan will fail.
(On Foswiki 1.1, scans during attachment upload will still work, as the stream is passed to clamd.  On Foswiki 1.0, the temporary file name will be passed resulting in possible access rights issues.)

---+++ Debugging
A =TRACE= constant can be enabled in =lib/Foswiki/Plugins/ClamAVScanPlugin.pm= and =lib/Foswiki/Plugins/ClamAVScanPlugin/ClamAV.pm= for detailed debug logging.

If ClamAV is reporting that it is unable to read the files, check several things:
   * Ensure that =Socket::PassAccessRights= is installed.   If not availabe,
   * Ensure that file permissions allow all attachments to be read by the clamd backend task.
   * If your system uses !AppArmor, be sure that the permissions allow !AppArmor to read the web attachments.  =/etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.clamd= should have a line to pemit read of attachments, such as: <verbatim> /var/www/foswiki/pub/** r</verbatim>
